# SunStar
A program that uses the turtle module to recursively draw a sun star with s sides, each side length n, v levels, and deviation angle θ 
1. Draw a line of length n/4. 
2. Turn θ degrees to the left. 
3. Draw a sun star side of length (n/4)/cosθ and level v − 1. 
4. Repeat the above in a way that creates the mirror image of what was already drawn
Variables accepted in this program will be of either type int or float
