# SunStar
A program that draws a sun star with s sides, each side length n, v levels, and deviation angle θ To draw a sun star side of length n, level v, and deviation angle θ, 1. Draw a line of length n/4. 2. Turn θ degrees to the left. 3. Draw a sun star side of length (n/4)/cosθ and level v − 1. 4. 
Variables accepted in this program will be of either type int or float
